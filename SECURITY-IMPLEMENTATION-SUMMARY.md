# Secure Shipment Request/Approval System - Implementation Summary

## üéâ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### Status: READY FOR TESTING (NOT COMMITTED YET)

---

## üìã What Was Built

A complete secure request-based authorization system that prevents brokers from accessing shipper shipment details without explicit permission.

### Core Security Features Implemented:

1. **Limited Visibility for Brokers** - Brokers can only see basic shipment info (city/state) until approved
2. **Request/Approval Workflow** - Brokers must request access; shippers must approve
3. **Role-Based Access Control** - Separate interfaces for shippers and brokers
4. **Audit Trail Ready** - All requests tracked with timestamps and status

---

## üîß Backend Changes (server-backend.js)

### 1. New MongoDB Schema: ShipmentRequest

```javascript
{
    shipmentId: ObjectId (ref: Shipment),
    brokerId: ObjectId (ref: User),
    shipperId: ObjectId (ref: User),
    brokerMessage: String (max 500 chars),
    status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected',
    requestedAt: Date,
    respondedAt: Date,
    shipperResponse: String (max 500 chars)
}
```

### 2. New API Endpoints (5 total)

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Auth Required |
|----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| `/api/shipments/:id/request` | POST | Broker requests access to shipment | Broker |
| `/api/shipments/requests` | GET | Get all requests (role-filtered) | Shipper/Broker |
| `/api/shipments/requests/:id/approve` | POST | Shipper approves request | Shipper |
| `/api/shipments/requests/:id/reject` | POST | Shipper rejects request | Shipper |
| `/api/shipments/:id/access` | GET | Check broker's access status | Broker |

### 3. Modified Endpoint: GET /api/shipments

**New Behavior:**
- **For Brokers (without approval):**
  - Returns: shipmentId, title, pickup (city/state), delivery (city/state), status, createdAt
  - Hides: ZIP codes, description, full shipment details
  - Adds: `hasAccess: false` flag

- **For Brokers (with approval):**
  - Returns: Full shipment details
  - Adds: `hasAccess: true` flag

- **For Shippers/Admins:**
  - Returns: Full details for all their shipments

## üîí Security Improvements

### Before Implementation:
‚ùå Brokers could see full shipment details (ZIP codes, contact info, special requirements)
‚ùå Brokers could directly create loads from any shipment
‚ùå No shipper control over who handles their shipments
‚ùå No audit trail of broker access

### After Implementation:
‚úÖ Brokers see only basic info (city/state) until approved
‚úÖ Brokers must request permission with optional message
‚úÖ Shippers receive all requests in dedicated page
‚úÖ Shippers can approve/reject with optional response
‚úÖ Full audit trail (request timestamp, response timestamp, status)
‚úÖ Brokers can only create loads after approval

---

## üöÄ User Workflows

### Broker Workflow:
1. Browse Shipments ‚Üí See limited info
2. Click "Request Access" ‚Üí Enter optional message
3. Wait for shipper approval
4. Receive notification (future: email)
5. Once approved ‚Üí See full details & create load

### Shipper Workflow:
1. Create shipment (existing feature)
2. Receive requests from brokers (page: Shipment Requests)
3. Review broker credentials (USDOT, MC, email)
4. Read broker's message
