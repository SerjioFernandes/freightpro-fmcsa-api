⚠️ PROBLEM: HOSTINGER SHARED HOSTING DOESN'T SUPPORT NODE.JS!
================================================================

Your current Hostinger plan is SHARED HOSTING.
Shared hosting does NOT support Node.js applications!

================================================================
YOUR OPTIONS NOW
================================================================

OPTION 1: Upgrade to Hostinger VPS (COSTS MONEY)
------------------------------------------------
- Needs: VPS plan (starts around $10-15/month)
- Setup: More complex, requires SSH, Linux knowledge
- Work required: Install Node.js, configure PM2, etc.
- Time: 2-4 hours

OPTION 2: Use Render + Vercel (FREE!)
-------------------------------------
- Already have accounts
- Your code is already there
- Just needs Render dashboard settings fixed
- Time: 5 minutes
- Cost: $0

OPTION 3: Use Railway.app (FREE tier)
-------------------------------------
- Easy deployment
- Free tier available
- Good for Node.js
- Time: 20 minutes

OPTION 4: Use Fly.io (FREE tier)
---------------------------------
- Free tier available
- Supports Node.js
- Time: 20 minutes

================================================================
MY RECOMMENDATION: OPTION 2 (RENDER + VERCEL)
