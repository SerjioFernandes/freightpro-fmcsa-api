⚠️ .htaccess IS A FILE, NOT A FOLDER!
================================================================

If you created a FOLDER called ".htaccess" → DELETE IT!

Instead, you need a FILE named ".htaccess"

================================================================
HOW TO CREATE .htaccess FILE
================================================================

1. In Hostinger File Manager → public_html/

2. Click "New File" button (usually top menu)

3. In "File Name" field, type:
   .htaccess

   ⚠️ Must include the DOT at the beginning!
   ⚠️ NO extension (.txt, .php, etc.)
   ⚠️ Just: .htaccess

4. In the file content area, paste:
----------
Options -MultiViews
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]
----------

5. Click "Save" or "Create File"

6. You should see a FILE (not folder) called ".htaccess"

================================================================
THEN DO THIS
================================================================

After creating the file:

1. Delete the ".htaccess" folder if you created one
2. Make sure you have the .htaccess FILE
3. Continue with Node.js app configuration
