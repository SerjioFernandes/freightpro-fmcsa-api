## 🌐 OPTION 2: Use Production URLs

### Your Production URLs:

**Backend API:**
- URL: `https://freightpro-fmcsa-api.onrender.com`
- Status: ✅ Running
- Health Check: `https://freightpro-fmcsa-api.onrender.com/api/health`

**Frontend (Vercel):**
To find your Vercel URL:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your "freightpro" or "cargolume" project
3. Click on it to see the deployed URL
4. It should be something like: `https://freightpro-xxx.vercel.app`

### Method 1: Check Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: https://vercel.com
2. Sign in with your GitHub account

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Backend Issues:
1. Check if backend is running: `curl http://localhost:4000/api/health`
2. Check MongoDB is connected
3. Check environment variables in `.env`

### Frontend Issues:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Connection Issues:
1. Make sure backend is running first
2. Check API URL in `frontend/src/utils/constants.ts`
3. Verify CORS is configured correctly
