================================================================
"Choose folder name:" field is REQUIRED
================================================================

If the field is required and won't let you continue empty:

✅ TYPE THIS: .

(the dot character)

This means "current directory" and extracts files directly there!

================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: Type exact folder name
================================================================

If you want to create a specific folder:

TYPE: frontend

This will:
- Create folder called "frontend"
- Extract files inside it
- You'll need to move them to root later

================================================================
BEST OPTION
================================================================

TYPE: . 

This extracts directly to public_html/ root!
