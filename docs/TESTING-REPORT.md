## üêõ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED

### Issue #1: Content Security Policy Blocking Agora.io SDK

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Video call feature completely non-functional  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

**Error Details**:
```
Refused to load the script 'https://download.agora.io/sdk/release/AgoraRTC_N-4.19.3.js' 
because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive
```

**Root Cause**: CSP headers in `_headers` file did not allow Agora.io scripts

**Fix Applied**:
```
File: _headers (Lines 11-15)

Before:
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' blob: https://cdn.tailwindcss.com; ...

After:
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' blob: https://cdn.tailwindcss.com https://download.agora.io; connect-src 'self' https://freightpro-fmcsa-api.onrender.com https://*.agora.io wss://*.agora.io; media-src 'self' blob: https:; worker-src 'self' blob:;

Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(self), camera=(self), payment=()
```

**Changes Made**:
1. Added `https://download.agora.io` to `script-src`
2. Added `'unsafe-eval'` required by Agora SDK
3. Added `https://*.agora.io` and `wss://*.agora.io` to `connect-src`
4. Added `media-src` directive for video/audio
5. Added `worker-src` for web workers
6. Updated Permissions-Policy to allow camera and microphone

**Deployment Required**: Yes - Netlify redeployment needed for headers to take effect

### Issue #2: Navigation Button Using Wrong Page ID

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: Dashboard Quick Actions "Create Shipment" button broken  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

**Error Details**:
```
Console Error: "Page shipment not found!"
```

**Root Cause**: Dashboard Quick Actions button calling `showPage('shipment')` instead of `showPage('createshipment')`

**Fix Applied**:
```
File: index.html (Line 2786)

Before:
<button id="dashboardCreateShipmentBtn" onclick="showPage('shipment')" ...>

After:
<button id="dashboardCreateShipmentBtn" onclick="showPage('createshipment')" ...>
```

**Result**: Dashboard Quick Actions button now navigates correctly
