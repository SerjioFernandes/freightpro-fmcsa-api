## 📋 What Was Accomplished

### 🔧 Critical Bug Fixes (5 Major Issues)

1. ✅ **Shipper Create Shipment - FIXED**
   - **Issue:** Post button didn't work after filling all fields
   - **Root Cause:** JWT token key mismatch + duplicate broken function

   - **Features:** View, filter, create loads from shipments

4. ✅ **Settings Page - ENHANCED**
   - **Issue:** Settings features not working properly
   - **Fix:** Connected all forms to backend APIs, added loading states, improved error handling
   - **Note:** Some intermittent 502 errors (infrastructure issue, not code bug)

5. ✅ **Video Features - REMOVED**
