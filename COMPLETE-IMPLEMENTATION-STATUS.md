## 🚀 What Was Built

### 🔒 Security Features

1. **Limited Visibility**
   - Brokers see only: city, state, title, status
   - Brokers DON'T see: ZIP codes, description, full details
   - Visual indicator: Yellow border + "Limited View" badge

2. **Request-Based Authorization**
   - Broker clicks "Request Access" → Opens modal
   - Broker writes optional message (500 char max)
   - Request sent to shipper with broker credentials

3. **Shipper Approval Dashboard**
   - Dedicated "Requests" page with 3 tabs (Pending/Approved/Rejected)
   - Full broker info displayed (USDOT, MC, email, message)
   - One-click approve/reject with optional response

4. **Access Control**
   - Only approved brokers see full details
   - Only approved brokers can create loads
   - All requests tracked with timestamps
