# 🧹 Cleanup: Unnecessary Files

## ✅ What I Removed:

1. ✅ **`backend/vercel.json`** - Deleted
   - Not needed (you're using Railway, not Vercel)
   - Was causing confusion

---

## 📋 Other Files You Might Want to Clean Up:

### Optional (Not Critical):

1. **`frontend-deploy.zip`** in Hostinger
   - Old zip file, can delete

2. **`backend-deploy.zip`** files
   - Old deployment zips, not needed anymore

3. **Documentation files** (if you want):
   - Keep the important ones
   - Delete old/temporary guides

---

## ✅ Your Current Setup:

- ✅ **Backend**: Railway (no Vercel needed)
- ✅ **Frontend**: Hostinger (no Vercel needed)
- ✅ **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- ✅ **Domain**: Hostinger

**No Vercel files needed!** Everything is cleaned up! 🎉

The `vercel.json` file has been deleted. Your setup is now cleaner!
