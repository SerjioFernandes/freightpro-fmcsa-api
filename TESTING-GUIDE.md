## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Request button does nothing"
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Verify backend is running and API_BASE_URL is correct.

### Issue: "Requests page is empty"
**Solution:** Make sure you created a shipment as shipper, then requested access as broker.

### Issue: "Navigation button not visible"
**Solution:** Refresh the page after login. Check console for errors.

### Issue: "Limited view not working"
**Solution:** Clear localStorage and re-login. Check if backend GET /api/shipments is returning `hasAccess` flag.

### Issue: "Backend 502 error"
**Solution:** Render.com might be cold-starting. Wait 30 seconds and try again.
